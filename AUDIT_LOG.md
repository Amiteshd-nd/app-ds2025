### [P0 foundations] — 2026-10-12
- Correction: the game is titled **Bangalore Times** (not Namma Quest / Namma Outbreak).
- Rule going forward: every user-facing string, package/app id and doc header says *Bangalore Times*; "NAMMA OUTBREAK" survives only inside the settled `docs/design/` files as the historical working title. Never introduce a third name.
- Correction: on ADR-66 (`src/` layout) and ADR-67 (layer names) the user delegated: "if anything better is there you can make it". Decided: keep both as built.
- Rule going forward: when the user delegates an engineering call, record the decision in `DECISIONS.md` and move on — do not re-ask. Reserve audit questions for taste, story and product calls.
- Correction: ADR-75 (Capacitor appId / SPM / plugins) was not understandable as written.
- Rule going forward: proposed ADRs shown at an audit get a one-line plain-English "what this means for you" before the technical text; purely technical calls with no product impact are decided, not asked.
- Mobile smoke: **sync OK, not booted** (no Xcode / Android SDK on this Mac — T-018).
